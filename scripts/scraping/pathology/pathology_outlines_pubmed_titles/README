This directory is used to generated 
pathology_outlines_pubmed.csv, which has columns 
Page Url, Page Title, and Bullet Text. Page Url is the url 
of the Pathology Outlines article. Page Title is the title of
the Pathology Outlines article. Bullet Text is the text of
the Pubmed Search title. 

To generate pathology_outlines_pubmed.csv, please run

python pathology_pubmed.py

Note that you will need python 3, and that the python 
virtual environment will work fine. Also note that you
will need to have already generated 
all_pathology_outline_articles.csv, which is generated
from scripts/scraping/pathology/pathology_outlines_ddx

To get the Pubmed search tags, please run

python get_pathologyoutlines_tags.py

Note that you will again need python 3, and that 
pathology_outlines_pubmed.csv should have been generated
previously.
